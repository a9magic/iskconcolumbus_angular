                    This is a pre-rendered dialog, which means that <code>$mdDialog</code> doesn't compile its
                    template on each opening.

                    The Dialog Element is a static element in the DOM, which is just visually hidden.<br>
                    Once the dialog opens, we just fetch the element from the DOM into our dialog and upon close
                    we restore the element back into its old DOM position.

                        test The mango is a juicy stone fruit belonging to the genus Mangifera, consisting of numerous
                        tropical fruiting trees, cultivated mostly for edible fruit. The majority of these species are
                        found in nature as wild mangoes. They all belong to the flowering plant family Anacardiaceae.
                        The mango is native to South and Southeast Asia, from where it has been distributed worldwide to
                        become one of the most cultivated fruits in the tropics.

                    <p>
                        The highest concentration of Mangifera genus is in the western part of Malesia (Sumatra, Java
                        and Borneo) and in Burma and India. While other Mangifera species (e.g. horse mango, M. foetida)
                        are also grown on a more localized basis, Mangifera indica&mdash;the "common mango" or "Indian
                        mango"&mdash;is the only mango tree commonly cultivated in many tropical and subtropical
                        regions.

                        It originated in Indian subcontinent (present day India and Pakistan) and Burma. It is the
                        national fruit of India, Pakistan, and the Philippines, and the national tree of Bangladesh. In
                        several cultures, its fruit and leaves are ritually used as floral decorations at weddings,
                        public celebrations, and religious ceremonies.
