                    A temple needs the support of its congregation to remain solvent and stable and to provide
                    services for the community on a regular basis. Tithing, the regular commitment of a monthly
                    donation to support the functioning of our temple, defines your relationship with Krishna.
                    95% of our community does not have time on a daily basis to offer physical service at the temple.
                    But you can still be a direct part of the seva here by supporting these activities through
                    financial contributions.

                    <p>The Hare Krishna movement is a popular name for the International Society for Krishna
                        Consciousness
                        (ISKCON), a worldwide community of devotees practicing bhakti yoga. This yoga is the eternal
                        science of
                        loving service to Krishna, or God. The philosophy of this movement is rooted in ancient Vedic
                        texts,
                        particularly the Bhagavad Gita (Song of God), which contains the essential teachings of Krishna
                        on how
                        to achieve the highest perfection of life.</p>
