                        Prabhupada's books as a
                        priority. Srila Prabhupada told us that Book Distribution is his life and soul. He also
                        said,<br/>
                        <i>"Even if one reads just one line carefully (from ISKCON books), his life will be successful!"<br/>

                <h5>Srila Prabhupada traveled around the world 12 times, delivered thousands of lectures, wrote
                    thousands of
                    letters, and met with many important scholars and dignitaries who very much appreciated his efforts.
                    In
                    addition to this rigorous schedule he translated 51 volumes of important scriptures. His books are
                    used
                    in many universities and are translated in 79 languages. Over 464 Million copies of these books have
                    been distributed so far.Please help spread this knowledge. Transcendental book distribution is the
                    greatest welfare activity for the world. Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura has called it the
                    brhat
                    mrdanga. He explained "If we do kirtan, it means we will hear within this room. But if we do book
                    distribution it means we will hear home to home, country to country, community to community".

                <blockquote> Your report of book distribution is very encouraging. Please go on increasing more and
                    more. Yes, you
                    should become the topmost temple for distributing my books. This is a very good proposal. That is
                    the
                    only way to please me. Distribute my books profusely. That is real preaching. (Letter to: Bala Krsna

                <blockquote>Go on selling books. That is my desire. (Letter to: Kurusrestha: - Ahmedabad 26 September,

                <blockquote>Your report of the book distribution there is very encouraging. Make program to distribute
                    our books all
                    over the world. Our books are being appreciated by learned circles, so we should take advantage.
                    Whatever progress we have made, it is simply to distributing these books. So go on, and do not
                    divert
                    your mind for a moment from this. I have full confidence in you. (Letter to: Ramesvara: - Mayapur 11

                    Mayapur 19 October, 1974)

                <blockquote>Prabhupada: You consult among you. So I want to see simply distribution of books in any
                    language. That I
                    want. (Room Conversation - July 27-28, 1977, Vrndavana)
